# CygnusOB212Collapse
A hypothetical simulation of Cygnus OB2-12 collapsing to form a Black Hole<br>
So last night I was working on this algorithm and I explained what it was but didn't.. show really what it did... so I give a demonstration of if Cygnus OB2#12 collapsed. The first file / visualization (initial.py) is when Cygnus is in its initial state, getting ready to collapse, and then the second file (collapse.py) is where the simulation is ran through step by step using the algorithm I was working on last night! Fascinating!

# Conclusion
This was based on research I did using Cirq by Google (Quantum Computing) to simulate the initial idea of a collapsing star using quantum mechanics principles, then I decided to do it by calculations the way I did using Cirq
but this time visualizing it instead of using Cirq itself so it would be more easily understood.
